Repositorio con los c칩digos de los trabajos presentados en la especialidad Redes Neuronales de FAMAF / Repository with the codes of the projects presented in the Neural Networks specialty at FAMAF.

Pr치ctico 1: The goal of this first assignment was to solve the differential equations of the "Integrate-and-fire" model to study the behavior of a neuron under this model.

Pr치ctico 2: The goal in this second assignment was to numerically solve the differential equation of the Izhikevich model to model the behavior of different kinds of neurons.

Pr치ctico 3: Here we implemented a feed-forward auto-encoder with one hidden layer of variable sizes to learn the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

Trabajo final: The final project of this specialty consisted of the implementation of a deep convolutional network to learn the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Different combinations of dropouts, optimization algorithms, and activation functions were explored to find the combination that best classified the data. Finally, the performance of the network was compared to that of a feed-forward neural network with a single non-convolutional hidden layer.
